Complex visual effects such as caustics are often produced by light paths containing multiple consecutive specular vertices (dubbed specular chains), which pose a challenge to unbiased estimation in Monte Carlo rendering.

In this paper, we propose a solution to importance sampling specular chains with seed placement using importance probability distributions reconstructed from historical samples. 
This outperforms state-of-the-art unbiased solutions with up to 40Ã— variance reduction.



Code will be available soon.
