Complex visual effects such as caustics are often produced by light paths containing multiple consecutive specular vertices (dubbed specular chains), which pose a challenge to unbiased estimation in Monte Carlo rendering.

We propose a solution to importance sampling specular chains by extending specular manifold sampling with importance probability distributions reconstructed from historical samples for better seed placement. 
This outperforms state-of-the-art unbiased solutions with up to 40× variance reduction.

Full code will be available soon.
